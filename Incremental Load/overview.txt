- Target:
# Various data loading design pattern: Full Refresh, Incremental Load, Hybrid Approaches
# F1 Project Load pattern
# Implementation

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Data Load Types:
+ Full Load: Process all data (Only for small dataset)
+ Incremental Load: Process little data that are changed between the previous run and current run (ETL pipelines)
+ Hybrid Scenarios:
++ Full Dataset received, but data loaded and transformed incrementally
++ Incremental dataset received, but data loaded and transformed in full
++ Data received contains both full and incremental files
++ Incremental data received. Ingested incrementally and transformed is full
