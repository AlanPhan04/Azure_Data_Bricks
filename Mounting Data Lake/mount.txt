Databricks File System (DBFS)

- Azure Blob Storage mount to the DBFS 
- DBFS is a distributed file system mounted on the Databricks workspace
- Key takeaway: DBFS is just a file system that help access into distributed data in Azure Storage, it's not a storage solution

- DBFS Root is the default storage for a Databricks workspace created during workspace deployment
    + Backed by the default Azure Blob Storage
    + Can be accessed via the web UI 
    + Query results are stored here
    + Default storage location for managed tables
    + Default storage location, but not recommended for user data
        drop workspace -> drop data as well
        -> Where to put user data?

--> Answer: Store user data in their Azure Blob Storage or ADLS
-> How to connect storage?
-> Can use previous protocols
-> Cons: 
    + Deal with long DBFS URLs
    + Use credentials to authenticate the storage account before accessing data from them
-> Solution: 
    + Mount these storage accounts to the DBFS; 
    + Specify the credential when the storage is mounted
    + Once it is mounted, each user that has access to the workspace can access the data without providing credentials
-> Benefits:
    + Access data without requiring credentials
    + Access files using file semantics rather than storage URLs (e.g. mnt/storage1)
    + Stores files to object storage (e.g. Azure Blob), so you get all the benefits from Azure

-> Until 2022, Azure introduces Unity Catalog: Automatically do the credentials
