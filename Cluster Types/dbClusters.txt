Cluster:
- Cluster is a collection of Virtual Machines (VM)
- There is a VM which is the Driver, which is responsible for allocating resources for other VMs - which are brokers

There are two types of Cluster:
- All purpose (Created Manually) (Suitable for adhoc analysis workloads)
- Job Cluster (Created by Jobs) (Suitable for ETL Pipeline, Machine Learning workloads)

- Cluster Pools???

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cluster Configuration:
- Multi Node: One Driver Node and Multiple Workers Node
- Single Node: Only one Node -> suitable for lightweight machine learning model / analysis workload

- Access Mode: 
    + Single User (Python, SQL, Scala, R)
    + Shared (Python, SQL) (Cluster is shared along Users, each process has its own environment -> They cannot see the data / credentials of each other)
    + No Isolation (Python, SQL, Scala, R) (No cross-processrization)
    + Custom: Legacy Configuration

- Databricks Runtime
    + Databricks Runtime (Spark, P/Lang, Ubuntu Lib, GPU Lib, Delta Lake, Other DBr Services)
    + Databricks Runtime ML (Everything from above, Popular ML Lib (PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, XGBoost, etc))
    + Photon Runtime (Everything from DR, Photon Engine)
    + Databricks Runtime Light (Runtime option for only jobs not requiring advanced features)

- Auto Termination:
    + Terminate cluster after X minutes of inactivity
    + Default (Single / Standard Cluster): 120 minutes
    + Range: 10 - 10000 minutes

- Auto Scaling: 
    + Specifies min/max work nodes
    + Auto scales between min and max based on workloads
    + Not recommended for streaming workloads

- Cluster VM Type / Size:
    + Memory Optimized
    + Compute Optimized
    + Storage Optimized
    + General Purpose
    + GPU accelerated

- Cluster Policy: Set rules for users in order to avoid accidents
    + Simplifies the user interface
    + Enables standards users to create clusters
    + Achieves cost control
    + Only available on premium tier

- Cluster Pool: A set of ready-to-use VMs in order to reduce the cluster start, auto scaling. 
    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Pricing:
    + Workload (All purpose/ Jobs / SQL / Photon)
    + Tier (Premium / Standard)
    + VM Type (General Purpose / GPU / Optimized)
    Purchase Plan (Pay As You Go / Pre-Purchase)

- What is calculated to pay?
    + The number of VMs
    + The number of Databricks Unit (DBU) 
        DBU: A normalized unit of processing power on the Databricks Lakehouse Platform used for measurement and pricing purposes
        + How to calculate DBU?

Cost = Total DBU + Driver + n Workers

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Cluster Pool:
    + Ex: Idle instances 1 & max instances 2
    + Remember to delete the pool after finishing the cluster/jobs, because users can be charged for letting the idle instances run unstoppably.

- Cluster Policy: A set of rules for admin in order to limit the users permissions, creating more simpler interface,... (clusterPolicy.png)
