------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- In order to access the Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)
    + Storage Access Keys (Each account)
    + Shared Access Signature (SAS Token) (can custom)
    + Service Principal: Create this to manage access to the ADLS

- There are two types of Scoped Authentication:
    + Session Scoped Authentication: Use the credentials in the notebook and authenticate to the Data Lake, authenticate until the notebook is detached from the cluster
    + Cluster Scoped Authentication: Use the credentials in the notebook and authenticate from the cluster, authenticate the cluster is terminated

- There are other kinds of authentication: (Learn Later)
    + AAD Passthrough Authentication
    + Unity Catalog

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Authenticate using Access Keys:
    + Each storage account comes with 2 keys (Why???)
    + Gives full Access to the storage account
    + Keys can be rotated (regenerated)

- Assign a key access to the Azure Databricks through Spark Configuration
