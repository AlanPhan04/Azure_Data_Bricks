Cluster:
- Cluster is a collection of Virtual Machines (VM)
- There is a VM which is the Driver, which is responsible for allocating resources for other VMs - which are brokers

There are two types of Cluster:
- All purpose (Created Manually) (Suitable for adhoc analysis workloads)
- Job Cluster (Created by Jobs) (Suitable for ETL Pipeline, Machine Learning workloads)

- Cluster Pools???

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cluster Configuration:
- Multi Node: One Driver Node and Multiple Workers Node
- Single Node: Only one Node -> suitable for lightweight machine learning model / analysis workload

- Access Mode: 
    + Single User (Python, SQL, Scala, R)
    + Shared (Python, SQL) (Cluster is shared along Users, each process has its own environment -> They cannot see the data / credentials of each other)
    + No Isolation (Python, SQL, Scala, R) (No cross-processrization)
    + Custom: Legacy Configuration

- Databricks Runtime
    + Databricks Runtime (Spark, P/Lang, Ubuntu Lib, GPU Lib, Delta Lake, Other DBr Services)
    + Databricks Runtime ML (Everything from above, Popular ML Lib (PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, XGBoost, etc))
    + Photon Runtime (Everything from DR, Photon Engine)
    + Databricks Runtime Light (Runtime option for only jobs not requiring advanced features)

- Auto Termination:
    + Terminate cluster after X minutes of inactivity
    + Default (Single / Standard Cluster): 120 minutes
    + Range: 10 - 10000 minutes

- Auto Scaling: 
    + Specifies min/max work nodes
    + Auto scales between min and max based on workloads
    + Not recommended for streaming workloads

- Cluster VM Type / Size:
    + Memory Optimized
    + Compute Optimized
    + Storage Optimized
    + General Purpose
    + GPU accelerated

- Cluster Policy: Set rules for users in order to avoid accidents
    + Simplifies the user interface
    + Enables standards users to create clusters
    + Achieves cost control
    + Only available on premium tier
